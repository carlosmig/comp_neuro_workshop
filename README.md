# WORKSHOP IN COMPUTATIONAL METHODS FOR BRAIN CONNECTIVITY AND MODELING

Franfurtk, Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics
From June 17th (Monday) to June 18th (Tuesday).

The workshop will introduce basic and advanced concepts for analyzing fMRI and M/EEG brain recordings, focusing on practical applications. The first part will introduce participants to the field of information theory and will end with the fundamentals of high-order interactions, a novel framework recently developed with potential applications in neuroscience. The next part of the workshop is focused on whole-brain modeling. We will cover aspects related to the philosophy of modeling in neuroscience, why we use models, and how we can construct models to reproduce the whole-brain dynamics of macroscopic recordings (fMRI, M/EEG). Finally, the last part of the workshop is dedicated to methods for estimating functional and effective connectivity using Dynamic Causal Modeling, with practical examples applied to real experimental setups.
